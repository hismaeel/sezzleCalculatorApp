Description: 
  This app is based around the JS library socket io, which allows bi direction communications, hence avoiding making a lot of http requests. 
  For a "live inter-client/chatroom" type scenario, this seemed like an efficient solution. The front end is vanilla JS, and the back end is nodeJs
